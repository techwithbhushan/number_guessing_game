**ðŸŽ¯ Number Guessing Game â€“ Python Mini Project**
A beginner-friendly Python console game where the program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. The game gives feedback like "Too low!" or "Too high!" until the correct number is guessed. It includes basic input validation using `try-except` to handle invalid inputs gracefully.

ðŸ”§ **Key Concepts Used**:

* `random` module for number generation
* `while` loop for repeated attempts
* `try-except` for error handling
* Conditional logic (`if-elif-else`)

Perfect mini project for Python beginners learning loops, input handling, and logic building.
